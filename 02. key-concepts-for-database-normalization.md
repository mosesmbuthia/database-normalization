## Understanding Database Normalization
In database normalization, we mainly put only tightly related information together. To find the closeness, we need to find which attributes are dependent on each other. To understand dependencies, we need to learn the concepts below.

**Keys**- These are the unique identifiers in a table, without these, it would be hard to tell one record from another, especially for information such as names which it is very possible to get people with similar names.

They ensure that data is not duplicated and that every record can be uniquely accessed.

**Functional dependency**- This helps to define the relationships between data in a table. ie. If you know the student `id` This can help you find other information about the student, such as name and maybe email address.
