## Understanding Database Normalization
In database normalization, we mainly put only tightly related information together. To find the closeness, we need to find which attributes are dependent on each other. To understand dependencies, we need to learn the concepts below.

**Keys**- These are the unique identifiers in a table, without these, it would be hard to tell one record from another, especially for information such as names which it is very possible to get people with similar names.

They ensure that data is not duplicated and that every record can be uniquely accessed.

**Functional dependency**- This helps to define the relationships between data in a table. ie. If you know the student `id` This can help you find other information about the student, such as name and maybe email address.

## Features of Database Normalization
**Data Redundancy Elimination :** - Data redundancy refers to the repetition of data in different parts of the database. Normalization helps in reducing or eliminating this redundancy, which can improve the efficiency and consistency of the database.

**Ensuring Data Consistency:** - Normalization helps in ensuring that the data in the database is consistent and accurate. By eliminating redundancy, normalization helps in preventing inconsistencies and contradictions that can arise due to different versions of the same data.

**Simplifying Data Management** - It simplifies the process of managing data in a database. By breaking down a complex data structure into simpler tables, normalization makes it easier to manage the data, update it, and retrieve it.

**Avoiding Update Anomalies:** - Normalization helps in avoiding update anomalies, which can occur when updating a single record in a table affects multiple records in other tables. Normalization ensures that each table contains only one type of data and that the relationships between the tables are clearly defined, which helps in avoiding such anomalies.

**Standardization:** - Normalization helps in standardizing the data in the database. By organizing the data into tables and defining relationships between them, normalization helps in ensuring that the data is stored in a consistent and uniform manner.
