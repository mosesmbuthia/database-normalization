## Database Normalization
**Database normalization** is the process of organizing the attributes of the database to reduce or eliminate data redundancy (having the same data but at different places).
It is an important process in database design that helps improve the databaseâ€™s efficiency, consistency, and accuracy.

Data redundancy unnecessarily increases the size of the database as the same data is repeated in many places and this may lead to inconsistensy problems which arise during insert, delete, and update operations.
